# Change Log

This document tracks noteworthy changes to the Flux JavaScript SDK.

The JavaScript SDK follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).
While the API is considered unstable until we reach `1.0.0`, we will attempt
to increment the minor version (`Y` in `x.Y.z`) if and when there are
breaking changes.

## [0.4.5] - 9/22/2016
